# Hello There ~
My name is Henry Son and I am currently a Junior Electrical Engineering Major on a Computer Engineering Track at the Cooper Union. I have a lot of interests but here are just a few I can think of off the top of my head: 
- reverse engineering
- pentesting
- networking
- fpgas

But all those interested above are nerd stuff, so here are my other hobbies: 
- volleyball 
- guitar
- gaming (mostly Valorant)

Some of my aliases you may see around are: 
- sonbyj01
- n1mda
- sonbae (recently added:))

I have a [blog post](https://blog.hson.dev/) that I've tried to update regularly buttttttttt haven't done so since last year heh...

But, speaking of networking, I have some self-hosted services under two domains: [sonbyj01.xyz](https://sonbyj01.xyz), [hson.dev](https://hson.dev). 

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonbyj01/) and on [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/sonbae1001). 

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:sonbyj01@gmail.com) about anything:)
